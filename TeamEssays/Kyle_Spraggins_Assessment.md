Individual Capstone Assessment
```
My group project for this course is multi-faceted with two large objectives. We are creating an
app for users to simultaneously record and upload data to a backup repository, as well as a secure
messaging app with encryption. The app will be able to use the existing camera apis for mobile devices
and backup the audio and video in real time. The messaging portion will have full end-to-end
encryption. We may also allow the user to select the encryption type, but that may prove to be too
complicated. We want this app to be a private and secure way for users to record data and
communicate with each other.

Some aspects of this project have been covered by coursework, while others have not. The
encrypted messenger is more relevant to coursework than the simultaneous video backup in my
opinion. Although some of the principles from Computer Networks, like communication protocols and
some cryptography knowledge, may be helpful as a precursor to building both parts of our app.
Software Engineering will be useful as well, the course taught a lot of good principles for developing long
term projects, working in a team, and creating user stories. Programming Languages, Python
Programming, and Computer Science I all introduced us to several different programming languages for
us to choose from and adopt principles from for our project. Every course has contributed to our
knowledgebase in some ways, we will likely draw from all of them, as this will likely be a very
complicated project.

I worked for two different companies during my co-op experiences over the years. At Hyland
Software as a Software Development Intern, I worked mostly with XML, XSLT, and Schemas. I donâ€™t
believe this will come into play for this project, although it is possible we could use XML in the backend.
At Siemens PLM Software as a Co-op in the Strategic Student Program, I created an OAuth module for
Mendix applications, generated C++ code, and worked on a web application for displaying 3D models. I
believe all three of these experiences are relevant to this project. We will be using OAuth for our


authentication solution, we may use C++ for part of the app, and the app will likely be a web application,
so that experience will be quite valuable.

I am very excited to work on this project, privacy and security are some of my favorite topics in
Computer Science. Both privacy and security are becoming afterthoughts in software development,
which to me is a dangerous trend that will not reverse until there is a widespread breach with
devastating effects. Additionally, some law enforcement agencies are attempting to get encryption
banned in software, I would like to prove that encryption is a good thing and should not be feared. I
hope that with this app we can show that security and privacy can be maintained in a complicated app
and prove how beneficial it is. The project will likely be quite difficult, but it will be a good test for our
programming skills. Working with apis, Oauth, and encryption will be great experience for our future
careers.

Initially, we will ensure we can reliably use the Google Drive upstream apis to stream video, and
get encryption and decryption working correctly. We expect reliable simultaneous video upstream with
no data corruption and minimal delay. We also expect secure encryption that cannot be cracked easily
in the messaging portion of the app. It may be difficult to evenly distribute the work for this project, but
we will do our best to distribute responsibility evenly among the group members. I will be satisfied with
my contributions when I have completed my tasks and have been involved in the work of the other
members as well. We will feel we are done when our app is fully functioning including video upstream
and secure messaging with as few bugs as possible.
