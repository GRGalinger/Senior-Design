# Fall Senior Design
### Project Abstract
Our project is based around a web application geared towards creating audio and video recordings and allowing the user to automatically back them up through either their Google Drive or Dropbox account. This application will allow the user, once they have been authorized through OAuth2.0 Authorization, to seamlessly create audio and/or video recordings directly within the app. When they are finished recording, their files will be encypted and sent to their desired account with use of Google Drive or Dropbox API.
