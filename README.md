# EZ-Drive
Ez-Drive is a web application geared around allowing the user to easily upload files to their preferred cloud services. These files can be uploaded to Google Drive, DropBox, or OneDrive through the use of their respective API libraries. Users will be authenticated through the OAuth2.0 Authentication framework in order to sign into their cloud service accounts. 

Transitioning from the 1st Semester to the 2nd, our project abstract was modified to fit a new vision for our project. The major change was transitioning from an audio/video recording platform with a minor focus on uploading files to only one cloud service through its API library, to dropping the audio/video component and focusing on uploading files to three different cloud services. This is why you will see some differences in the description of our project goals in 1st semester assignments.
