# EZ-Drive
Ez-Drive is a web application geared around allowing the user to easily upload files to their preferred cloud services. These files can be uploaded to Google Drive, DropBox, or OneDrive through the use of their respective API libraries. An option to encrypt the files may be available in the future. Users will be authenticated through the OAuth2.0 Authentication framework in order to sign into their cloud service accounts.
