# Fall Senior Design
### Project Abstract
Our project is based around the idea of creating a web application geared towards creating audio and video recordings and allowing the user to automatically back them up through their Google Drive account. This application will allow the user, once they have been authorized through OAuth2.0 Authorization, to seamlessly create audio and/or video recordings directly within the app, and when finished, send them to their Drive account with use of the Google Drive API.
