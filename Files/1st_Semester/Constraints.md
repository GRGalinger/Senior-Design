# Constraints

### Economic Cost
As far as financial costs go, I do not think our group will be significantly affected. In terms of an overall cost for a successful solution to our project, as of right now, the only contributors to cost would be eventually paying for a web server to host our final solution, as well as potentially some additional charges if we need to incorporate a database along side the web server. This is something my group has not fully looked into at the moment. When the time comes, we will make sure to explore all of our options for the best solution. 

Our project does not rely on a source of freeware or shareware software, so we will not be constraint in that regard. In addition, I do not feel our group is restricted by access to limitation at UC or other facilities, as we are not relying on these resources for any aspects of our project.

### Time
The senior design course being a yearlong does not put too much of a time constraint on our group, as I feel that a year (two semesters) is enough time for us to complete everything. With that being said, I think that this time will seem to go by faster than we expect with all of us having to focus on our other classes, real life events, and so on. I think it will be important to remain focused on reaching our milestones for this project in order to avoid a lor of work being backed up.

### Scope
I think that our team does agree on the scope of the project. Granted, it is still fairly early in the development process, so I don't think we fully know the exact scope that everything will be. I think that each of us understands the what our contribution to the overall project will be. 

### Professional/Technical Expertise
Our project will require expertise in the following:
* Javascript
* Web application development
* PHP databases
* Encryption algorithms
* Web design

Lack of expertise in any of these areas will likely add a lot of time to research and information-gathering. This could add a significant amount of time to the project length depending on lacking areas.

### Ethical/Legal
Our project will likely not have any ethical ramifications. Legally, based on the general trend of anti- encryption legislation appearing in front of Congress, we may have to change our encryption implementation based on any new legislation.

### Security
There are several potential security concerns for our project. The app will rely on users being logged into some third-party account to upstream video to. As a result, some of the app security will rely on the security of third-party services and APIs. It is also possible that communications could be intercepted while the device is operating on an unsecure network. Additionally, the messenger aspect will be secured with end-to-end encryption. We will need to pick a reliable and secure encryption method to maintain the security of the messenger. The user is ultimately responsible for the content of their videos/messages.

### Social
Our project will be designed in a way that it can be used by anybody that has access to the application. The project will benefit society by providing a tool anyone can use to securely upload videos and images to the platform. It will also provide an encrypted messenger that users will be able to trust when sending sensitive information. In turn, these benefits will enhance the quality of usersâ€™ lives by providing them security and confidentiality with their data.

### Environmental
The project will only be able to be used wherever the user has access to the internet and does not conflict with any existing laws and legislation. The project will not have any impacts on the environment

### Diversity/Cultural Impact
The platform will be designed with United States laws and regulations in mind. The platform will be designed so that anyone may use it as long as the translation to their language is reliable. If there are laws prohibiting the final product in a specific region or country, it will not be available in that area.
