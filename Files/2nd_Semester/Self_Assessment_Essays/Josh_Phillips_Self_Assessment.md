## Assignment #6 â€“ Self Assessment 
## Name: Josh Phillips
## Members: Kyle Spraggins, Grant Galinger 

## Part A
### My individual contribution to this assignment involved working on the assignments and working on the specifications of EZ-Drive, as well as contributing to some of the technical documents. Last semester I had goals to improve on my technical writing, communication with team members and learn/ implement encryption for a message system that would be included in EZ-Drive. I was able to build upon many of these goals, such as communication and technical writing, however the messaging system for EZ-Drive was dropped and the encryption of messages became irrelevant. 

### I contributed to the assignments and helped work on the technical documents. I did this by referring to similar examples of technical documents as well as building off of what I had previously learned in my technical writing courses. Some of the obstacles included not being able to physically meeting as a team due to distance learning, but we were able to overcome these by using Slack to create adiscourse as a team for our project. 

## Part B
### Our group was able to finish our project, EZ-Drive as well as reaching many of the original milestones we had as goals to reach before the end of the two semesters. We were able to create a web application that allows documents to simultaneously be uploaded to Google Drive, DropBox, and OneDrive. The design is simple and easy to use which was one of our main focuses as well.

### I learned that when working in a group it is very helpful to have a very strong project manager/leader and we had that in Grant. Grant kept us focused and ensured that we never missed a deadline as well as writing most of the code used in our web application EZ-Drive. I would agree with Kyle, that Kyle and I contributed equally to the assignments, but Grant deserves special recognition. Communication was successful given that we were not able to physically meet as a team but we were able to communicate effectively via Slack.
