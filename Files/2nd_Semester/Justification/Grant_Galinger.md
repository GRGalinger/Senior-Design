## Summary of Hours and Justification

## Total Hours from both Semesters: 103 hours
Below is a breakdown of everything I worked on from both semesters. The first semester I spend a lot of my time on the assignments and setting up the basic foundation of our project. This included setting up our GitHub repository, configuring our PHP web server, and doing research on different API components.

The second semester I was able to reall ystart working on the development side of things. Most of my time was spent implementing each of the three cloud service APIs. This took the bulk of my time when you inlcude all of the testing and debugging that needed to take place. Along with that, I was able to keep our database up to date, as well as implement the Dropzone.js library for the drag'n'drop file uploading feature.
