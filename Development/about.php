    <h1> What is EZ-Drive? </h1>
    <p> EZ-Drive is web application designed to help you easily upload files to your favorite cloud services all from one place. 
        We currently offer connection to Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive services. 
        This application was designed by Grant Galinger, Josh Phillips, and Kyle Spraggins for our senior design project.

    </p>
    <h1> How does it work? </h1>
    <p> EZ-Drive works by utilizing the public API libraries for each of the cloud services. 
        These APIs allow us to form a connection between this application and your specific cloud service account. 
        The connection is based around the principles of OAuth 2.0 Authorization.
